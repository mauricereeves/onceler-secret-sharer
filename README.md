# README

The Onceler Secure Secret Sharing service. A very very very very very very very very simplistic service for sharing of secret values that self-destruct after a certain point and/or are viewed.

Use at your own risk.

No guarantees.

YMMV

## TODOS

- Add Tailwind to the project for better styling (though it looks alright right now)
- Add auth so someone can login via OAuth providers like GitHub, etc
- Fix the failing tests. Sad. Works on my machine.
- Better documentation throughout.
- Update the host name hack to use environment variables for different envs
